Such a great idea. I started a ceres co-op account about 18months ago, we had 10 of us in the group with a commitment to spend $50 each per month, we end up spending a whole heap more than that which is good as new min order is now $800 per month (we spend around $1000-1500 per month) but end up only ordering every 6 /8 weeks as the process between asking everyone to pop their orders in and order takes so long.

I found the whole process hard going at times:

- I set up a spreadsheet (really not my strong point) in google docs,  and we have a facebook group (private) to discuss who wants to share what. Everyone has a soft copy of the product list and they use that to decide what they want. It would be great for everyone to have access to the online system but that makes me a little nervous as the account is in my name and I think it would be more confusing if every one put there own orders in (I feel it would take me longer to check it and get it to tally this way)
- Once everyone has their orders in the spreadsheet, I go in and add to ceres portal and check prices along the way and update spreadsheet so they both tally
- The hardest thing is getting the ceres online portal to tally with our spreadsheet, this month actually was the first time it tallied, normally it can take me hours to check, recheck and recheck again(due to an equation not working, product missing or other human error)
- Then I email everyone with their final total inc. shipping
- Once theyâ€™ve paid into my account I order

A couple of things.

- I felt it was taking too much of my time and others werenâ€™t contributing, eg if something didnâ€™t turn up everyone expected me to do the calls to ceres, not really what a coop is about if you ask me. So I put it out the group an option for a) everyone to take turns doing the order each month OR they pay me 5% of their order to cover my time. The group went with the latter option except one girl who wanted to help. Although having her help has been more time consuming so im going to tell her next month that its easier for me to do it alone. Argghhh!
- I would love for it to be easy, eg, an online platform where everyone can go in and check prices, add their own order, it would work out splits when people are sharing
- I now have 7 of us in our group, as thatâ€™s all I can handle, but I hate the inclusive nature of that, I would love to not have to limit it, if it was easy id happily open it up to the neighbourhood
- I would love to do more than ceres too, incorporate fresh goods or just other products but its too hard to get my head around at the mo (with baby and work and study!) If there was some sort of open source how to  get started info would that be just great ðŸ˜Š
