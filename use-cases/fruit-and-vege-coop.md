# Fruit and Vege Co-op


## current process

weekly rhythm:

- receive price list from supplier
- populate order form to send to members for ordering
  - 2 prices: smaller crate is 15% more
- order close by date
- when orders are closed, admins tweak to figure out how much can actually be ordered
- orders sent to supplier
- supplier responds
- order is finalized on Tuesday
- final order is sent to members
- (used to have members pay here)
- order is received on Thursday
- order is packed
- any changes are compared against final order
- head packer sends message to admin about changes
- admin tweaks spreadsheet and updates costs
- admin sends updated spreadsheet
- members should pay immediately upon picking up food
- admin tracks payments, chases up non-paying members
- admin pays supplier invoice within 7 days


## pains

- payment tracking
- availability of supplier inventory
- admin spends roughly one hour per day of the week, for only $30 total
- difficult to jump into admin role, big learning curve

# order form info

Orders close at 5 pm on Monday. Delivered to Petone Depot on Thursday 28 April.

Things to note:

1) Because of tweaking, we may occasionally need to add something to your order that you haven't asked for. This wouldn't happen very often, but if you REALLY don't want a particular item, perhaps you are allergic to it, then select "Don't add" on that row. If you click "0" you may have it added. But this would be rare, particularly as we start up.  Also, with some items such as eggplant and capsicum you may get slightly more or less than you order due to ease for packers and not cutting whole vegetables up - costs will be altered to reflect this.

2) The two different sections for fruit and veges are for produce sold by the kilo VS by the count. For example, loose potatoes and a 5kg bag of potatoes are in different sections.

3) Don't forget that these prices do not include GST, nor our 15% extra for costs and packers. So your total will be 30% more (plus a $1 admin fee) if you are working out your budget or making comparisons. Also your weights may be slightly different to the spreadsheet, we do not alter amounts less than 100g.

4) The comments section is where you can communicate with the tweakers. Some reasons to use this would be to let them know if you are on a budget, so you could ask them not to tweak you more than a certain amount, or that you really, really want avocados so you'd rather get 10 than none at all if that helps get enough for a crate, or that you think they're doing a wonderful job!

5) We can only order things that Fresh Direct supply for the month, so some things you may be able to get elsewhere, like cucumber, we can't access at the moment.

6) Don't pay until we tell you the final amount on Thursday after all the veges have been packed.

7) Organise your bags/containers and drop them off to the Depot before packing day. These need to hold all your items, be labelled on the outside really clearly and obviously with your name and member number (so it is visible when they are out and filled with items) and be able to stand upright by themselves. You need to have two lots unless you want to drop off the empty ones back at the Depot in between deliveries.

8) You can pick up your order between 3pm and 6pm on the day of delivery from the Petone Depot, Doreen Doolan Mall. We will organise some other people to be pick up points further afield, eg Upper Hutt, Naenae. These are still to be arranged. If you could be the pick up person/point for you area, or if you would rather a pick up point closer to you, please email the admin account petoneorganicfruitandvegecoop@gmail.com and weâ€™ll organise it through the google group.

9) If an item has ** and a separate price, this means if we get enough orders to fill the larger crate size, the cheaper price will be charged.

Comments section: Please add any further comments about your order here, including any specific requests about tweaking (e.g. if you order five avos and really want to make sure you get them, you could put "Max 10 avos please" below, so the tweaker knows you would be happy with ten. If you are on a budget, please put the maximum total amount you want to pay (including GST and co-op's 10%).
