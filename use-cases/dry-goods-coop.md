# Dry Goods Co-op
Current process

- $20 one time fee ("buy-in") to be a member
- no order fees, only volunteer contributions
- every order is managed by somebody
- capped at 25 members, operates by consensus
- general level of fatigue (frustration) amongst group towards ongoing work
- biggest orders are once per month from two major suppliers
- small orders might stay open till minimum order quantity is met
- Sarah setup spreadsheet, someone runs order through process
- all communications through facebook
- bank account through kiwibank


## process for big orders

- spreadsheet opens with price list
- members order what they want, but must be close to "an outer" (minimum order quantity)
- members use facebook to coordinate achieving outers together
- admin makes excecutive decisions to tweak orders
- spreadsheet populates order form
- order is sent to supplier
- supplier sends back invoice
- admin double checks invoice for any price changes
- admin updates spreadsheet with invoice info
- admin sends final order info to facebook group
- members pay their appropriate amount
- group doesn't pay invoice till members pay in full
- order is received
- roster of packers to pack received order
- members provide containers beforehand
- members pick up containers, might pay extra for refrigeration costs


## other notes

- pain: someone updated wrong person's order, that person doesn't want to pay extra, consensus is a difficult way to deal with this problem
- sometimes go out to wider network to reach minimum order quantity like for maple syrup
- small orders don't use fancy spreadsheets, larger orders do
- have a collective buffer (a few hundred $)
- only way to pay for collective costs is through one-time membership fee
- private facebook group for paid members
- an order is an event in the group
  - if you are ordering, you are "going to event" to subscribe
  - allows people to subscribe to what they want and not be overloaded by all orders
- requires daily facebook use, otherwise miss payments, etc
- pain: hard to keep track of what people owe
- wish: integrate finances with ordering
- pain: no way to manage credits, currently don't hold any credits, refund any overpayments (bank fees for withdrawls)
- pain: each supplier sends and receives orders in a different way
- some people do invisible work (Ange at depot)
- some people have unique skills (Sarah with spreadsheet)
- if you want to join the co-op, you need somoene to vouch for you (reputation system)
- on an invitee to be a buddy for a new member
- value props: money saving / access to better quality / community
- connect with community kitchens / proto-businesses
- wholesale prices over retail prices
- pain: depends on key members
