- my background is purchasing
- suppliers would not enjoy supply chains
- did your co-op start at the same time as the Petone co-ops?
  - yes, around April of 2015
- how did your co-op start?
  - started on Facebook page "Real Foods New Zealand"
  - there seemed to be interested in a Wellington _and_ a Petone group
  - got people keen in Wellington
  - emailed the suppliers
  - got wholesale accounts
  - bumbled along
- how many suppliers do you order from?
  - every 4 to 6 weeks we do Ceres and Chantal and (bos ops?)
  - pacific harvest, seaweed, urban unity (?)
  - been hard to grow
  - haven't had the core community
  - been slow
- where do things live?
  - my house
  - send out a spreadsheet, get everything back
  - then got sorted on Google docs
- how many people?
  - about 15
  - people come and go
  - 10 core, ~15 orders
  - don't have membership fee
  - i do packing, i charge $5 per person fee
  - i just wanted it to grow to see it worked
  - seems now i have people who don't want to work but are okay with fee
  - change fee to 5% (brings in about the same)
  - people are happy with this, comes to about $5
  - it's all packed up and ready for them
  - 15 people, one helper once a year, two helpers twice a year
  - packers get nothing, but you only have to pack once a year
  - kinda good and kinda bad, but works
  - coordinating volunteers is really massive
  - i feel good about this system being as smooth as it can be
- do you accept members from anywhere who want to join?
  - yes, but now we can be selective
  - we're meeting all our box quantities
    - we're not desperate for other people
  - we could grow, but workload would become out of control
- what is the work you have to do?
  - work involved in spreadsheet and ordering
- spreadsheets!
  - one spreadsheet
  - starts with an info part
  - chipped it off the Petone group through frank
  - have a date to put in order by
  - order from all suppliers every time
  - has outer and minimum order
  - once everyone has placed order, i tweak manually
  - reason i can't tweak automatically is i'll add to my order or some people are okay to get more or others aren't
  - tweak order until it equals the box quantities
  - bold orders are out of stock
  - blue means we couldn't reach outer quantity with Ceres, but we could get from Chantal
  - the spreadsheet used to be the whole catalog of all the suppliers
  - i cut this to have what we actually order
  - put instructions with how others can add what they want
    - generally people can't do it themselves, so email me
    - then you put it in, but then doesn't reach minimum, annoying
  - portal is a pain as we have to order line by line
  - 30% of Chantal stock is out-of-stock, even when shown on portal
  - added in member balance
  - Sarah shows how to protect sheets and regions
  - miss Excel, Google Sheets is slow, but reaches everyone
- how do you pay?
  - i pay up-front with credit card
  - Chantal comes back with actual invoice, which is often less
  - sometimes 3.5k is max of my money
  - i've never have anyone not pay
  - once person might not pay, but i keep a buffer that is the fee
  - i use the fee to get my groceries cheaper
  - also have to buy scales, bags, boxes, etc; save up glass jars
  - don't usually have to chase people
  - easy because one payment every 6 weeks
  - credits is a pain
  - shipping is a percentage, so confusing to calculate pay
- i had this idea that every job could be priced
  - people could choose their job
  - would have to track time
  - also newbies take 3x time to learn
- do you use Facebook?
  - i don't like Facebook, prefer email
- packing
  - if i do it myself, would take a whole day
  - storage room under house
  - i keep it onlocked from outside
- so excited like $1 an order
- what would you like it look like?
  - people want to see what others have orders
  - you'd want a whole range of the catalog
  - but not everything because need to fill outers
  - would be great to talk with supplier
  - would be great to talk with bank
  - how does tax work?
    - is the fee income or a donation?
    - thought there was minimum threshold, but now been saving to pay tax as income
- more thoughts
  - more co-ops in the area
  - Ceres co-ordinated a co-op!
    - but people send me small orders "hey want 600g of pumpkin seeds, 300g of sunflower seeds"
    - but people treat me like i should be available for customer service
  - original people have the feel, but newbies don't always get the feel
  - people think i'm a shop that makes a profit
- introduction
  - send an email, some people are on list but never order
  - would be good if they had to do something to become member, have the feeling of being a member
- more suppliers?
  - Urban Hippie people are good for us to order
  - Pacific Harvest are cool
  - Bowstocks
  - could do more if it was easy
- "all i keep thinking is i wish i had software." - Lisa Julian, Wellington co-op admin
- how long?
- every 4 to 6 weeks per order, how much per order?
  - packing is 4 or 5 hours
  - admin is about the same
  - 10 - 15 hours?
  - getting about half of minimum wage
- would you carry on doing it as is?
  - i'd like to do it as a co-op
  - i want it to exist, but rather not do all the work
  - i'd rather everyone did their bit
  - want people to buy in better
  - envious of Petone debot
- is time or money a problem?
  - i'm a mum, so i have other paid work i could do
  - i have other things to do
  - running the buying group is so much work
  - would be good to delegate to someone who wants it
- want
  - access better prices
  - reduce packaging
  - create community
- used to be part of Petone Fruit and Vege
  - loved it, was in from the start
  - was a drive away, so got pedantic about quality
  - Sarah: was Fresh Direct or Ceres, now only Ceres
- what would you want from a crowd-funding pledge?
  - Sarah: what if:
    - co-ops could get pledge $100 to get free 3 month trial
    - pledge heaps then get us 5 coming to your house and helping you use it
  - trialing the software
- fees
  - in terms of fee, depends on how good the software is
  - nobody said anything when i added the fee
  - the user is the pain, makes sense to pay per user
  - i'd be happy to pay quite a bit
- do others see the value? (or would they just do what they tell you?)
  - they'd do what i tell them to do
  - not many people can run a co-op
  - packing
    - could have packing lists that are useful
    - there's always going to be work
- do people only pay for what they get?
  - kinda rough trust
  - one time i computed everyone's exact order, was a pain
  - now everyone gets what they get, a little more, little less, usually more
- we should have a co-op support group
- two ideas for co-op groups:
  - feature items: pick 15 things, post photos, put price (with premium)
    - everyone comments on Facebook with order
  - meet once a month for order
    - social gathering
- watching eagerly, happy to help, want to see it come to fruition
- is a good return on investment?
  - banks aren't offering interest at the momentA
- i think with Ceres would be interested
  - they have customer service reps already dealing with co-ops
  - they are probably cool to work with
  - got a letter saying "keep your co-op quiet"
    - about sending price lists around
    - some people don't realize sensitivity
  - would be interested to know what Ceres thought
