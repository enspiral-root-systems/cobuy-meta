core system: multiplex parallel intent into serial order, de-mux shipment into invoices

```
O --> intent -                                       -> invoice
O --> intent --|                                   |--> invoice
O --> intent ----> order -> supplier -> shipment -----> invoice
O --> intent --|                                   |--> invoice
O --> intent -|                                      -> invoice

- how to become a co-op?
- tradies ordering...
- most active audience is stay-at-home moms
- one-off groups - buy food for an event
- recurring groups - families, communities, friends
- value prop: access to otherwise inaccessible goods and services
  - especially relevant for gluten-free, paleo, ...
- focus on admin, not general co-op members
- admin pain is too much work
- general member pain is confusion
- value prop: transactional records of what's happened over time
  - safely change with easy undo / redo
- these co-ops have made member caps due to admin pain
- payment options
  - charge $1 per user per month
  - charge 0.10 per dollar spent using system
- we take a cut out of _how much you save over buying from supermarkets_
- actual volume
  - dry goods co-op: 3.5k / month
  - fruit & vege: 1.5k / week
- product revenue == salary costs
- co-op turnover * 0.10 == 27.5 k / month
- co-op turnover ~= $0.5 million ?
- my.enspiral
  - must use bank account with bank provider that has API
  - must hae Xero account
  - we partner with Xero to integrate with any bank account
     - is this possible?
- contact Ceres and Chantel to understand how we might integrate with them
  - integrating suppliers mean any co-op in the system hasautomatic access to inventory and can immediately start an orer
- need
  - mockup
  - pitch
    - is it solvign a problem?
    - will it reduce carbon emissions?
    - will it grow over time?
  - interviews
  - quantify carbon impact
    - transport
    - individually wrapped packaging
    - shelf-life
    - difference between 50 people who buy from supermarket versus 50 people who buy as co-op
- \* learnings from this workshop
  - target admins as focus
  - phrase not as charging money but saving money
  - how do we integrate with bank accounts?
