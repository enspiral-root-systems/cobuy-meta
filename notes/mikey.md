core system: multiplex parallel intent into serial order, de-mux shipment into invoices

```
O --> intent -                                       -> invoice
O --> intent --|                                   |--> invoice
O --> intent ----> order -> supplier -> shipment -----> invoice
O --> intent --|                                   |--> invoice
O --> intent -|                                      -> invoice

- how to become a co-op?
- tradies ordering...
- most active audience is stay-at-home moms
- one-off groups - buy food for an event
- recurring groups - families, communities, friends
- value prop: access to otherwise inaccessible goods and services
  - especially relevant for gluten-free, paleo, ...
- focus on admin, not general co-op members
- admin pain is too much work
- general member pain is confusion
- value prop: transactional records of what's happened over time
  - safely change with easy undo / redo
- these co-ops have made member caps due to admin pain
- payment options
  - charge $1 per user per month
  - charge 0.10 per dollar spent using system
- we take a cut out of _how much you save over buying from supermarkets_
- actual volume
  - dry goods co-op: 3.5k / month
  - fruit & vege: 1.5k / week
- product revenue == salary costs
- co-op turnover * 0.10 == 27.5 k / month
- co-op turnover ~= $0.5 million ?
- my.enspiral
  - must use bank account with bank provider that has API
  - must hae Xero account
  - we partner with Xero to integrate with any bank account
     - is this possible?
- contact Ceres and Chantel to understand how we might integrate with them
  - integrating suppliers mean any co-op in the system hasautomatic access to inventory and can immediately start an orer
- need
  - mockup
  - pitch
    - is it solvign a problem?
    - will it reduce carbon emissions?
    - will it grow over time?
  - interviews
  - quantify carbon impact
    - transport
    - individually wrapped packaging
    - shelf-life
    - difference between 50 people who buy from supermarket versus 50 people who buy as co-op
- \* learnings from this workshop
  - target admins as focus
  - phrase not as charging money but saving money
  - how do we integrate with bank accounts?

## dragons' den

- got contact of well-being officer at VUW co-op
- uber co-op
  - is there a way for groups to provider supply chain service offerings?
    - as in, use Cobuy to provide a food packaging / meal delivery service
- all co-ops in NZ?
- value prop: bump up low-income to high quality, for those who otherwise can't afford
- compare to my food bag's cheap offering
- provide recipes for how people can cook health food cheaply
  - "i want these meals this week"
- what interactions do communities do together?
  - "how do i cook \_\_\_\_"
- "i want 5kg of green vegetables for $10"
  - whatever it is, you'll get $10 worth
- pre-sale commitments, what community-supported agriculture does for local farms
- turn-over of supermarkets?
- need 2,500k customers to reach your 27.5k/month?
- take thought out of buying food
- to win, show business is sustainable, validated enough to fly, market size
- show enough potential or presale customers to sell
- can you remove the admins?
  - _the next generation of co-ops_
- reward your heaviest users the most
  - example: sell children's clothing at premium, mountain gear at below cost
  - get rebate based on purchase volume
  - rebase -> credit at store
- are we empowering admins to have a sustainable job?
- what is the business model for a co-op admin in order to have a good job?
  - how many customers do _they_ need?
- "you're spending all this time already caring for organic food, why don't you get paid and bring in more friends?"
- 10% more efficient vs 10x more volume
- (time rich + money medium) versus (time poor + money rich)
- how do we use automation and artificial intelligence to create jobs?
- power to scale and empower people to do valuable work?
- provide digital infrastructure for others to provide on-demand services to others
  - admins (neighborhood dad / mum)
  - regional coordinator
  - suppliers
  - packager
  - cooks
  - transporters
- connect suppliers so they are available when an admin starts
- package in branded packaging
- takeaways:
  - higher income people want to pay for convenience
  - provide the platform for others to sell services and have job
  - participants: consumers, producers, processors, transporters
- maybe at first focus on groups doing it together, then later get agents to join who focus on the processing as a value-add service.

## ad-hoc-racy

- how can we show that this is a thing that **will** happen and others want
- get stats on:
  - how much carbon is produced by landfill waste
  - how much carbon is in individual packaging
  - local suppliers cannot access supply chains because of supermarket duopoly
- here's the total market cap of consumer co-ops in the world
- here's how many co-ops run through Ceres
- $1 per order per user
  - problem is this only incentivizes buying from suppliers with large catalogs
- email our interviewees with potential business model
- what will we do with surplus of profit?
  - MORE CO-OP SOFTWARE!
- Enspiral is the global leader in fintech (financial technology) for grassroots orgs
- fill the hole of being just 5 devs
  - put Damian's face - business expert who sells bespoke solutions
  - we've built Cobudget, Co-nnection, etc
  - Josh, Susan
- we've saved money doing consulting to invest in our product
- we'll use pledgeme to find our crowd of early adopters
- internal Enspiral cobudget (collaborative funding)

- Ceres, how do they work?
  - they're just matching up spreadsheets that they have
  - there are still buyers with spreadsheets
  - internally they use xml files?
