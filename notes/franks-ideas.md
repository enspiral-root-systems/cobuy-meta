# Frank's ideas for co-op app

Frank is a key member of the co-op. She ran all the admin for the fruit and vege co-op herself for the first 6-8 months. She has been sending Sarah ideas she has on what she would like the app to do. They are listed below in no particular order.

- Have each person's order sent to them once the tweaking is done, rather than sending a bulk email with everyone's orders
- Have it automatically update the products from the excel price list that is sent out each week.
- Have it record which member's have and haven't ordered that week, and maybe send a reminder email out to those who haven't ordered a few hours before the cut off.
- An automatic print out of individual orders that could be attached to each person's box when packing.
- Automatic print out of final orders on one page that doesn't include any item not ordered that week. (for packers' reference when packing.)
- keeping track of people's money, so registering when people have paid, and being able to enter who the packers were that week and credit their account for the following week.
- When a paid for item doesn't arrive, being able to select that item, and the app will automatically credit their accounts, which is taken off their next order automatically
- import the excel sheet of the price list each week and select which products to have without having to manually enter prices etc
- Reminder sent out before orders close to people who haven't submitted their order
- Email sent to people with details of their order so they can check it is correct before tweaking (including a link to edit it if nec)
- Automatically populate the order sheet when a new price list comes out, so the orderer can just select the things they would like to show up, without having to type them in.
- when there are two similar varieties of the order sheet, e.g. two kinds of apples, but not enough for a crate of both, switch over any orders from the least popular variety to the more popular if they haven't put don't add for that variety.
- Track people's payments and send a reminder if they haven't paid by a certain day.
- Check the invoice that's sent out and A) send an alert if there a price changes, B) update any price changes to people payments and C) automatically take off any out of stock items.
- For items by the count that don't make a crate (but are close to), send an email out to people who have ordered that item asking if they would like to increase their order, then automatically editing their orders until the crate count is reached.
- Make sure the total due matches the invoice cost
- Be able to cope with different suppliers, especially if we start getting more members or locals supplying us with produce.
- Have a sheet to be sent to the supplier for produce that is bad quality which includes - photo, reason why, amount affected, refund required (e.g. full, half etc)
- Have a section where the crate returner can upload the crate return invoices and they get emailed directly to the supplier.
- Have some system for managing the waiting list and new members who join.
- Have a system for emails so people don't get overwhelmed or sent emails after they leave.
- Have a calendar in it for organising the roster, with built in reminders sent.
- Be set up so it prints really easily for the individual packing lists

## Questions
It would be good to talk about how the co-op and this app will work together.
- Do you want the co-op to trial it for you?
- Is it just for dry goods and vege co-op or are you planning to get other co-ops on board?
- Will there be a charge? If so will our co-op be charged as well, or is there some reimbursement for the help our members have given to the set up etc?
