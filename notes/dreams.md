# dreams

> what do you wish was true in the distant future?

- take the power back
- enable people to have control
- not choices made by corps
- small part of a larger system
- accessible to anybody (our parents, etc)
- not much work (plug info in, get info out)
- everybody gets what they want: food, community
- not have to deal with angst
- intergenerational
- we're all doing this (not just female-centric)
- where is our place in the overall system? (how do we do our part and come together?)
- lots of unexpected spin-offs tht arise from food that are unrelated to food (networking without networking, community)
- mutally beneficial relationships not just between people but also groups
- enable, inspire but not requier, inclusivity
- allow for peope who work full-time, have families
- visible (cooking) vs invisible (admin) skills, give credit for effort
- time banking without give and take hours, possible between strangers
- how do we match value from bread in exchange for accounting sevices?
- how do we acquire new skills?
  - co-op has already upskilled members
- make the inner workings very upfront, so people can easily see the "behind the scenes"
- see the activity live!
- any novice can come in, see what they want, do what they need, be on a learning journey
- create a buddy system for newbies (an interpreter for understanding documented process)
- how does the structure of the co-op work so everyone feels involved and empowered yet thigns can still be done easily
- invitation to be involved

## themes

- FUN!
- we're all doing this together
- creating a path of least resistence
- community building in a practical sense (not theoretical)
- spurring / generating lasting positive change
- works for everybody (spectrum of engagement)
- redefine how we value work: multi-dimensional value instead of compartmentalized value
- everybody has a part to play / has value to contribute
- local people, suppliers, distributors: distributed across everywhere (fractal groups)
- come as yourself, offer your own skills, receive value for your work, learn new skills, lead others by example, support each other
- community connecting people and groups, locally, in region, ...
