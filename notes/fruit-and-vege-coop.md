# Fruit and Vege Co-op

## process

weekly rhythm

- receive price list from supplier
- populate order form to send to members for ordering
  - 2 prices: smaller crate is 15% more
- order close by date
- when orders are closed, admins tweak to figure out how much can actually be ordered
- orders sent to supplier
- supplier responds
- order is finalized on Tuesday
- final order is sent to members
- (used to have members pay here)
- order is received on Thursday
- order is packed
- any changes are compared against final order
- head packer sends message to admin about changes
- admin tweaks spreadsheet and updates costs
- admin sends updated spreadsheet
- members should pay immediately upon picking up food
- admin tracks payments, chases up non-paying members
- admin pays supplier invoice within 7 days

## pains

- payment tracking
- availability of supplier inventory
- admin spends roughly one hour per day of the week, for only $30 total
- difficult to jump into admin role
