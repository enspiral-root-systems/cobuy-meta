# LCC Jam Session
**4 June 2016 @ BizDojo, Wellington**

**Present:** Sarah Rogers, Dan Lewis, Iain Kirkpatrick

## Event Info

After you’ve been selected to take part, the first event is the LCC Jam. This is a one day event to take your venture to the next level. Here you’ll meet collaborators, advisors and even potential users and customers. Our partner organisations will be bringing expertise and resources. We’ll follow a lightly facilitated process so that you can get heaps of work done and insight on areas of your venture that need input.

Think of it as validation, insight generating, action based collaboration. In the past, contributors at Jam style sessions have gone onto become, advisors, mentors, and even investors.

What will happen:
- Jam kicks off at 11am. You’ll get to know other teams, and hear from our low carbon expert
- Vince from EECA. You’ll then have an hour to get ready for the Jam process.
- We’ll hear from PledgeMe’s Anna Guenther about crowdfunding
- Collaborators arrive: lunch, Tommy Millions pizza and Almighty juice - 1pm to 1:45pm
- You’ll be introduced to the contributors and the Jam process - 1:45pm to 2:00pm
- Jam Round One: a facilitated process where you work with contributors to give them insights
and feedback. 2pm - 3pm
- Jam Round Two: same as above, but changing collaborators - 3pm to 4pm
- Feedback and round-up - 4pm - 4:30pm
- Socialising and drinks (wine, beer and non alcoholics).
